I was neon, I was the nearest door
I was the sign that said you've been here before
I swear I could see it, swear I could see it all so clear


I was steady, I was soft to the touch
Cut wide open, did I let in too much?
I swear I could feel it, swear I could feel it


Am I gonna lose myself again?
Am I gonna lose myself again?
I quite like the person that I am
Am I gonna lose myself again?


I was neon, I was a floodlight
Arms out reaching for everything in sight
I swear I could be it, swear I could be it


Am I gonna lose myself again?
Am I gonna lose myself again?
I quite like the person that I am
Am I gonna lose myself again?
Am I gonna lose myself again?
Am I gonna lose myself again?
I quite like the person that I am
Am I gonna lose myself again?



Am I gonna lose myself again?
Am I gonna lose myself again?
Am I gonna lose myself again?
Am I gonna lose myself again?
Am I gonna lose myself again?
Am I gonna lose myself again?
Am I gonna lose myself again?
Am I gonna lose myself again?
Am I gonna lose myself again?
I don't want to lose myself again
